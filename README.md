# trakt-watch

A small CLI to mark items watched on trakt. This lets you:

- Mark movies/episodes as watched
- Rate movies/episodes
- Remove items from your history
- Query your recent history

This uses [traktexport](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/traktexport) internally to authenticate, so follow the steps [here](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/traktexport#auth) to login/setup your credentials.

## Installation

Requires `python3.11+`

To install with pip, run:

```
pip install trakt-watch
```

## Usage

You can set the `TRAKT_USERNAME` environment variable so you don't have to pass it every time.

```
Usage: trakt-watch [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -u, --username TEXT  Trakt username  [env var: TRAKT_USERNAME; required]
  -h, --help           Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  progress  mark next episode in progress
  rate      rate movie/tv show/episode
  recent    show recent history
  unwatch   remove recent watched item
  watch     mark movie/episode as watched
```

To watch entries, you can provide a URL, or search for a movie/TV show/episode. By default, will use now as the watched time:

```
Usage: trakt-watch watch [OPTIONS]

  Mark an entry on trakt.tv as watched

Options:
  --url URL                   URL to watch
  -a, --at DATE               Watched at time (date like string, or 'released')
  -r, --rating INTEGER RANGE  Rating  [1<=x<=10]
  -l, --letterboxd            open corresponding letterboxd.com entry in your browser
  -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.
```
